Hacker News Comments Analysis

In this project, I will take the posts from the Hacker News website (https://news.ycombinator.com/) and analyze which types of posts receive the most comments, and how timing affects the amount of comments received. There are 2 types of posts:

1) Ask HN - Users ask a question to the Hacker News community.
2) Show HN - Users share projects or information they may find useful to the Hacker News community.

This is a guided data science project from the DataQuest "Data Science in Python" course.
